<h2>Ithaca Falls</h2>



<p>
  Ithaca Falls is a sizeable waterfall located within the city of Ithaca. While the hike
  may be short the view is incredible: a massive waterfall flowing into a calm pool of water
  perfect for swimming. Ithaca falls use to be owned by Cornell but was given sold to the city in the year 2000.

  While traveling to Ithaca Falls, it is highly recommended to visit the city of Ithaca. Inside the city there
  are countless options for food and recreation. Furthermore, you can visit Cornell, the famed ivy league school
  and Ithaca College. Cornell hosts both incredible architecture reminiscent of an old European town and high tech facilities.

<p>
  Inside the city, you can visit the Ithaca Commons - a home to many storefronts. Here you can find nearly any type of food you can think of
  while browsing countless stores. Some prominent features in Ithaca are the Cornell bell tower, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and the suspension bridge which passes over fall creek.

         While the hike to Ithaca Falls may be short, I highly recommend exploring the city.
         One could easily spend an entire day walking around the commons and the adjoining streets.
