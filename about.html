<h2>About</h2>



<p>
  This website was designed to be a way to encourage more people to visit or contribute
  to the natural sites of Central New York. The overall design of the site was to
  show as much of a park as possible without boring the reader.

</p>
<h3>Content</h3>

<p>
  My philosophy is that
  reading about a park is nice, but it doesnâ€™t make a strong enough impression to encourage someone
  to visit. I decided to use high quality pictures to show off some of the incredible views
  that these areas have to offer.
  In doing so, I used many of my own pictures that I took while at these locations. However, due to
  the quality and my general lack of photography skills I decided to use pictures others took.
  The sources for these can be found at the bottom of this page.

</p>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>
  To make the navigation simple and easy to use, I decided to structure the site so that the user
  could access any park that they were interested in via a dropdown menu located on the global navigation.
  While the global navigation only has four items, I am confident that users will be able to navigate the site
  quickly.

</p>

<h3>Organization</h3>
  <p>
    This site's organizational structure is fairly simple but effective. All parks are
    assorted in a drop down menu while the about and preparation guide are located directly next to them.
    As for individual webpage organization, I decided to write a short blurb on interesting features or
    events that took place at the park or natural site. Following this, I placed three high quality pictures
    to give the user a better understanding of what the park looked like. Next I added a small recommendation
    on items to bring or warnings. Finally, I placed a map to show the location of the park or to show trails within the park.


 </p>

 <h3>Design</h3>
 <p>
   I decided to go for a clean design that focused the user's attention on the images of the parks. I felt that
   a large image at the top of the webpage would improve interest in the parks. For the color scheme, I went with a forest
   green to help convey the feeling of the outdoors.
 </p>

 <h3>HTML / CSS</h3>
 <p>
   For application of html and css in the site, I worked to keep structuring consistent throughout the site by using
   server side includes for both the footer, header, navigation, and html boilerplate. With css I created a fairly responsive website
   that will work from mobile devices to 4k monitors.
