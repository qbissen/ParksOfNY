<h2>Letchworth State Park</h2>



<p>
  Letchworth state park is one of the most impressive sights of Central
  New York. The park includes over 65 miles of trails and paths that
  people can bike, hike, or ride horses on. During your tour of the park
  you will see the immense strength and persistence of nature as you pass
  through gorges carved by the mighty Genesee River.

</p>
<p>
  Some gorges are nearly 600 feet deep and contain spectacular waterfalls. If you have
  plans of staying overnight, there are several camp grounds and lodges
  that can be used during winter months. As for water activities,
  Letchworth features kayaking, white-water rafting, and swimming.
  Finally, Letchworth offers a hot air-balloon ride that will give you an
  incredible, big picture view of the park. There are also
  facilities for business retreats and meetings.
</p>
<p>
  The history of the park began after the revolutionary war in which the native
  Seneca tribe was forced to concede the land to the United States due to their
  allegiance to the British. In 1859 the land was purchased by a William Pryor Letchworth
  who began construction of the Glen Iris estate. This project including the building
  of roads and walkways that allowed people to view the waterfalls and gorges.
  Once this was complete, Letchworth gave the land to New York State on the condition
  that the land was to become a public park.
