<h2>Taughannock Falls State Park</h2>



<p>
  Taughannock Falls is the largest single drop waterfall east of the Rocky Mountains.
  The area surrounding the falls in an incredibly scenic and impressive gorge that is nearly 215 feet in height.
  While approaching the falls, one can wade through a slow moving river or choose to hike
  through a shaded trail. While directly approaching the waterfalls in prohibited due
  to falling rock danger, there is a sizable viewing area about 50feet from the falls that
  still gets misted from the falling water.

</p>
<p>
  Taughannock got its namesake from a Delaware chief who was killed in battle near the falls
  and was subsequently thrown from atop the falls. It is also theorized that the falls were
  simply named after the natural beauty of the region.

</p>
<p>
  The history of the parks begins with the acquisition of the territory following the American
  Revolution in which the Cayuga Tribe as forced to abandon the territory due to their allegiance
  with the defeated British. Throughout the early 19th century the creek was used for the
  creation of gunpowder and other munitions. Later, the land was purchased by New York
  State and in 1925 was converted into a state park.
