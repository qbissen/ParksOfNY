<h2>Preparation Guide</h2>



<p>
  Hiking and adventuring through parks should be fun, however there are a few things that you
  should be aware of. In this guide you will be taken through some of the basic requirements needed
  for camping and hiking.

</p>
<h3>Hiking in State Parks</h3>
<p>
  Hiking in state parks is fairly easy, you really don't need to buy expensive equipment. The only real
  requirement is to bring money for the admission fee which ranges from $1 to $6. Other recommended items can
  be seen in the list below.

</p>

<ol>
  <li>Water Bottle </li>
  <li>Hiking Boots </li>
  <li>Sandals </li>
  <li>Swimwear </li>
  <li>Sun Screen </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Finally, one basic rule that every hiker should be aware of is: "Leave nothing but footprints, take nothing but pictures".
</p>

<h3>Camping in State Parks</h3>
  <p>
    Camping in State Parks is slightly more complicated. Some parks will have premade camp grounds for you to use, others such as the Yellowbarn State Forest
    will not. I would recommend brining the following items:


 </p>

 <ol>
   <li>Tent, poles, and stakes</li>
   <li>Tarp</li>
   <li>Sleeping bags, sleeping pads</li>
   <li>Pillows</li>
   <li>Flashlights</li>
   <li>Firewood</li>
   <li>Lighter</li>
   <li>Cooking supplies</li>
   <li>Insect repellant </li>
   <li>Rainwear</li>
 </ol>

 <p>
   Please keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list. Before camping I would highly recommend researching
   both the area and supplies you need.

</p>

<p>
  While camping within a state forest, please follow all New York State Laws regarding camping as seen <a href=http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/41282.html>here.</a>
