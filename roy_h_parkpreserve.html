<h2>Roy H. Park Preserve</h2>



<p>
  Roy H. Park Preserve is a fairly unknown yet beautiful hiking location near Ithaca.
  Upon getting to the park there are two primary parking locations to choose from.
  One will allow you to take a boardwalk across a series of wetlands into a dense forest.
  The boardwalk was recently constructed in 2013 and allows you to see wildlife such
  as beavers, fish, and a variety of birds. Upon entering the forest, there are several
  small trails to choose from. Each of these paths leads you through a verdant wood.
  The primary difference between this park and some of the others recommended locations is that
  this park rarely sees more than ten people at a time making it perfect for those
  who want to focus on nature.

<p>
  The second parking location gives access to a series of trails through a field and into
  a scenic woods and gorge. The gorge is approximately 150 feet deep and has several small
  streams running through it. These streams are slow moving and flat making them
  perfect to wade through on a hot day. On some of these streams, there are small waterfalls
  and cool swimming pools.

<p>
  Due to the size and relatively low number of visitors, you can easily spend an afternoon
  relaxing in the shade or reading a book. This park is easily one of the most peaceful
  locations on the trip.

         While exploring the Roy H. Park Preserve, I would recommend bringing sandals and
         swimwear. To hike the park, I would recommend giving yourself two to three hours.
